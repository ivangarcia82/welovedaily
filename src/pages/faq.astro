				<AccordionItem header="What happens after I've submitted my work?">
					<p>After you've successfully submitted your work we'll review your submission. If we see fit on the selected channel we'll get in touch. Keep in mind that a reply on your submission may take a day or two.
					If you don't receive a reply, we're sorry to disappoint, your submission was not selected to be featured.</p>
				</AccordionItem>

				<AccordionItem header="Why do you ask a fee for submissions?">
					<p>Selecting the best content for the Welovedaily channels takes time. With the revenue we gain from submissions we are able to cover expenses such as hosting and server costs.</p>
				</AccordionItem>

				<AccordionItem header="How do you handle payments?">
				 	<p>We handle payments via a PayPal link. When your work is selected we will get in touch via email. Attached to this email we will add the payment link. Reviewing of the submissions can take 1-2 days. At the moment we only handle payment via PayPal.</p>
				</AccordionItem>

				<AccordionItem header="What's the difference between a Regular and a Pro submission?">
					<p>With a Regular submission, you will get one post on one of the 4 channels. You'll be mentioned in the description with name and your Instagram handle.</p>
					<p>With a Pro submission you will get the same as a Regular submission plus the following benefits; more screen real-estate, your branding will be included in the post and you'll be tagged for even faster engagement options for our audience.</p>
				</AccordionItem>

				<AccordionItem header="How should I deliver my project?">
					<p>We appreciate it if projects get delivered via one of the following platforms: Instagram, Behance or Dribbble. Of course links to portfolio websites are also welcome.</p>
				</AccordionItem>

				<AccordionItem header="Which Instagram accounts do you manage?">
					<p>Content regarding web, app and User Interface design we post on the account @welovewebdesign. This is currently our biggest account. Everything regarding the visual appearance of a brand, wether it's online or offline we'll post on @welovebranding. On @weloveillustration we post different styles of artwork and illustrations. Lastly we also manage @weloveanimations, it may be the smallest but it has the biggest viral possibility.
